Don't forget to install all the deps to make this shitty db work
(make sure that EF core matches the version of the .NET in the project)

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQLite
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools


Just to make it clear, class library is the place
where you put all the data access logic, so you can use
it in other projects via services like shown in FlightService.cs

DTO(Data Transfer Object) is a class that is used to encapsulate data
for transfer between layers of an application.
